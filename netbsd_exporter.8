.Nm
can be served by

to allow Prometheus to scrape the metrics with the same interface as
the node_exporter provides.
Hence by default, metrics are printed out to stdout with a minimal
HTTP header preceded.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl Fl no-http-header
Disable HTTP header in output
.It Fl Fl no-syslog

request verb and URL via
.Xr inetd 8 .
